A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This is a site I worked on throughout the year, at first as just a wireframe but ultimately turning into this site.
So here you can see my first ever website, it's not pretty or good but it's the first one I did and I'm proud of how far I've come since.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Getting Started

### Installing

```
Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop
```

Or

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MartinP3/portfolio.git
```

### Running

I suggest using Visual Studio Code for editing the code and running the Live Server extension if you wish to avoid breaking your F5 key.
